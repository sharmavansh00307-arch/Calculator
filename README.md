The primary objective of this project was to develop a fully functional and interactive calculator using core
web technologies such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The aim was not only to build a working
application but also to gain a deeper understanding of how frontend technologies combine to create
userinteractive tools. Through this project, the focus was on implementing essential mathematical
operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, along with handling user inputs and
generating accurate outputs. Another objective was to improve coding practices, including clean
structuring of HTML, proper component styling using CSS, and writing efficient JavaScript logic for
event handling and calculations.
